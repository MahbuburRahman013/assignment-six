    <h2 class="text-3xl py-5">Scope of var, let and const:</h2>
    <h3 class="text-2xl py-2">var :</h3>
    <p class="w-[70%]">In JavaScript, var is the function scope. That is, it has access inside the function in which it is declared.It has no block scope so it cannot be blocked by code blocker.It can redeclare variables and reinitialize them</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl py-2">let :</h3>
    <p class="w-[70%]">The "let" keyword has block scope, which means it is accessible only within the block of code in which it is declared.It does not have function-wide scope like "var."It has block scope so it can be blocked by code blocker.It can redeclare and can't reinitialize.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl py-2">const :</h3>
    <p class="w-[70%]">The "const" keyword has block scope, which means it is accessible only within the block of code in which it is declared.It can't redeclare and also can't reinitialize.</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl py-5">use cases of null and undefined:</h2>
    <p class="w-[70%]">Both null and undefined in JavaScript mean that a variable's value is missing.But they are not the same.Undefined: A variable is "undefined" when it has been declared but has not been assigned a value.This usually happens when you declare a variable but don't set a value. <br> Or want to access an element of an array or object which does not exist.Null is a deliberate assignment to a variable to indicate that the variable has no value.Usually used to denote the value of a variable</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl py-5">REST API:</h2>
    <p class="w-[70%] mb-7">Rest API means representational state transfer. And API means application programming interface.Let us try to learn about rest API.When we fetch data from Web API to our website according to rest then it is called resources.Suppose you have a resource named student.Get that url link when you want to read it.<br><br> Again use post when you want to create it.Again, if you want a student to use a student's resources, then use a unique ID to get it.If you want to update, use put.You can also delete in this way.And these are the https mathord.Thanks to the Rest API, working with the web developer's API has become much easier</p>
